### Hi there, I'm Ryan - aka LiminalNotion ðŸ‘‹

##  I'm a husband, father, gamer and aspiring amateur game developer!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 3D Museum housing my childrens artwork.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Unity.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything within my scope that will help me learn!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any tips, tricks, or resources benefiting an amateur programmer / indie dev.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have never coded anything until December 2020!  Learning and having a blast!
